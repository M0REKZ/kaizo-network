This is the source code for Kaizo Network by +KZ, based on DDNet

Make sure to follow the terms of the license if you use Kaizo Network specific code.

I tried to separate Kaizo Network code from DDNet code but that is not possible in some cases.

This repo also uses code from the following mods that are NOT made by +KZ:

[DDNet-Insta](https://github.com/ddnet-insta/ddnet-insta)

[F-DDrace](https://github.com/fokkonaut/F-DDrace/)

[Pointer's TW+](https://github.com/Pointer31/tw_plus)

[Nheir's Bot Mod for Teeworlds](https://github.com/nheir/teeworlds)
